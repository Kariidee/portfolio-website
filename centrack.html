          <h1>Meet Centrack</h1>
          <p>
            A responsive application that helps users save money quickly, in preparation for a big purchase or expenditure. Users will be able to track their finances, while setting goals for planned expenses.
            This concept application was a course project with a project brief for a money- saving tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the UI/UX Designer for the entire project. I came up with the User Flows, Wireframes, Brand Guidelines, conducted User Testing and made changes to my final UI Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on the project in the entire month of July 2021. </p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            Before jumping into the design and defining key user stories, I did some research on current competitors in the market. Based on popular budget apps in the iOS App Store,
            it was difficult to come across features that incorporated multiple goal options, alongside a budget calculator and budget tracker.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>
            Based on a variety of User Stories provided in my project brief, I was able to settle on three that highlighted important features to
            include in the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the user stories, I was able to then determine Entry Points, Success Criteria and Task Analysis to construct a concise User Flow
            for each screen.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h2>Wireframe</h2>
          <p>
            From my project brief, I was required to only create wireframes for a single user flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to focus on: “as a user, I need to be able to tell the tool what my savings goal is and how long I have to reach it,
            so that I can save accordingly”.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using pen & paper, I was able to sketch low-fidelity wireframes for the single user flow.
            Once I was satisfied with the overall layout of each screen, I decided to digitalize the wireframes to mid-fidelity.
          </p>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>
              By using InVision, I created a Prototype for my Mid-Fidelity Wireframe. Three participants were assigned the task of testing the user flow. During testing, participants were requested to navigate through the prototype,
              in order to create a new goal and determine the length of time and monetary amount, intended to reach desired savings goal.

          <div>
            <h2>Branding & Design</h2>
            <p>
              I created the brand name, logo and entire branding strategy for the application. The brand name is a play on words to Track Money - in this case Cents. Additionally, the opportunity to save money always make sense (cents)! The primary
              and
              secondary version of the logo symbolize a cent sign with the line running across it. In this case, the empty space, also reverts back to the Transaction tracker in the page, which shows how much of a users budget is made up of income
              and
              categorized expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
              The color palette focuses heavily on teal as the primary color, since it elicits clarity, trustworthiness and reliability, which are all important traits users want to feel, when dealing with their personal savings.
              Secondary colors are vibrant and fun in order to communicate confidence and ease of use.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Based on constructive feedback from participants during user testing, I made necessary edits to initial Transaction Screen and changed the Goals screen.
              Now the layout looks cleaner and provides more visibility.

              My final design consisted of a single user flow and 10 screens.
