          <h1>Meet Ideal Meal</h1>
          <p>
            A web-based responsive recipe application that takes users dietary preferences into consideration when looking for recipes. Users are able to filter through specific diets and ingredients, in order to find the ideal meal.
            This concept responsive web application was a course project with a project brief, to meet the needs of its users and solve the problems they face with existing recipe apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the UX/UI Designer for the entire project. For the UX portion, I applied design thinking processes and principles of Lean UX, to properly research and create deliverables consisting of User Personas, MVP document, User Flows,
            Interactive Prototype and Usability Tests.
            In the UI portion, I created Visual Designs, Preference Tests and created breakpoints from XS to S, M, and L screens.
          <p>
            I worked on the project from the start of February 2021 till end of May 2021.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            First, I began my process of competitive analysis. I researched popular recipe apps to identify their key objectives, strategy, and market advantage, followed by SWOT Analysis and UX Analysis. In the UX Analysis, I identified layout,
            layout,
            navigational structure, compatibility, differentiation and call to action amongst each competitor. Once I had an idea of other apps and features on the market, I recruited 3 participants, who enjoy cooking and currently use other recipe
            apps,
            in order to conduct User Research through interviews. Unanimously, all participants agreed that by including a filter for specific allergies/dietary preferences, it would be highly beneficial not only to those with health concerns but to
            those that don’t have certain ingredients readily available.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>
            I built User Personas to help identify the target users of my application. These users were all educated consumers with distinct busy lifestyles, that are also focused on their health and the food they intake. By building out User
            Personas
            and identifying the Minimum Viable Product, I was able to create User Stories to signify the Jobs to Be Done. By creating 6 User Stories of Needs and Wants, an entire User Flow was built.

          <h2>Wireframes & Prototyping</h2>
          <p>
            By working through 4 Rounds of Crazy 8s, to create low-fidelity wireframe sketches with pen and paper, I proceeded to create a prototype on Marvel app. This prototype was used in my usability test amongst 3 participants, to determine ease
            of
            use and flow when using a recipe app. Participants were able to identify errors that should be revised. By incorporating helpful feedback, I was able to digitalize my the screens into mid-fidelity wireframes.

            <h2>Branding & Design</h2>
            <p>
              I created the brand name, logo and entire branding strategy for the application. The brand name is straight forward and focuses on find the “Ideal Meal”. In regards to color, I was focused on evoking feelings of health, nutrition and
              optimism with primary shades of green and red. I chose Montserrat for Headers and Open Sans as Body Typefaces, since they’re modern, clean and legible, which are important traits, since users need to read distinct and clear directions,
              when
              following a new recipe.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              My final design consists of 11 XS Mobile Screens, alongside breakpoints for S, M, & L Screens. Users will be now be more inclined to cook and find recipes that satisfy not only their individual tastes but also their dietary preferences.
